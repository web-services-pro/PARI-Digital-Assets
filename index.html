              <h4>Focus on Assets, Not Services</h4>
              <p>The value comes from the digital asset doing the work, not your personal efforts. We prioritize building and acquiring assets that generate income independently.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="principle-item">
              <h4>Acquire or Control, Don't Always Create</h4>
              <p>There are plenty of valuable digital assets already created by others. Smart dealmaking often involves leveraging existing assets rather than building from scratch.</p>

            <div class="principle-item">
              <h4>Rent for Recurring Income</h4>
              <p>The model is about renting or licensing assets for continuous, ongoing cash flow. One-time sales become recurring revenue streams.</p>

            <div class="principle-item">
              <h4>Automate for Passivity</h4>

          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>PARI stands for Passive Automated Recurring Income. It's a business model focused on creating income streams that generate revenue repeatedly without requiring your ongoing time or effort. Think of it like digital real estate - you set it up once, and it pays you continuously.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">
            <h4>How is this different from traditional business models?</h4>
            <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Traditional models often require trading time for money. PARI focuses on leveraging existing digital assets to create income that flows automatically. Instead of creating new products, we repurpose what you already have into multiple revenue streams.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>You likely have more assets than you realize! Social media posts, emails you've sent, presentations you've given, or even your expertise and audience can be valuable assets. We help identify hidden opportunities in what you already possess.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Our partnerships are typically risk-free for you. We often work on revenue-sharing models where you only pay us when we generate income for you. We handle the upfront work and investment, and we both benefit from the results.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Timeline varies depending on the asset and opportunity. We typically start with small tests that can show results within 30-90 days. Once we prove the concept works, we scale it into a sustainable income stream.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Absolutely! You maintain full ownership of your original assets. We typically work through licensing agreements or revenue-sharing partnerships that benefit both parties while preserving your ownership rights.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Educational content, courses, books, email lists, social media followings, software tools, and proven marketing materials all work well. The key is assets that can be repurposed, licensed, or leveraged for recurring revenue.</p>

          <p>Our team - headed by <strong>Mr. Basel Hakim</strong> - is dedicated to the <strong>passive automated recurring income</strong> model. Having experienced the difference between "do once, get paid once" income and income that stacks continuously, our focus is on becoming <strong>digital dealmakers</strong> who leverage the power of digital assets and distribution.</p>
          
          <p>This approach creates predictable, repeatable income streams that allow for financial certainty and the freedom to not have to actively work for every dollar. We operate like digital landlords, building a portfolio of income-generating assets that work in the background.</p>
